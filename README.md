# Web-Weekly Planner
Created a web version of the Weekly Planner using the Razor Pages model, Visual Studio, C# and razor syntax.

## Project Goal

The project goal was to create a Razor Page application and familiarise myself with the razor syntax and how a web application can be created using ASP.NET.

### MVP

- To convert one of the models from the previous project into a usable model for the ASP.NET Razor Page application
- To implement some of the basic CRUD functionalities. (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- To implement a service layer 
- To test the services using mocks



### Current Functionalities

- CRUD pages for all 4 models (Colours, Notes, Activity, Days)
- Delete confirmation page
- Filter options for both Activities and Notes

* Drop down menu option when selecting a Day or Colour for both the Create or Update function
